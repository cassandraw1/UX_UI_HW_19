          <h4> Navigation and Site redesign for The Saint Patricks Association </h4>
          <p>The Saint Patrickâ€™s Association (SPA) faced challenges with their website, including accessibility,
            navigation, and user engagement. In response, our team executed a comprehensive redesign, incorporating
            captivating visuals, intuitive navigation, and essential design principles. I played a key role, focusing on
            a competitive analysis, low-fidelity prototypes, and usability testing. Our user persona, Rosemary, guided
            our decisions. After thorough user testing, we improved navigation and clarified content. The redesigned
            website aligns with the organization's goals and adds significant value. In the future, we advise the
            organization to integrate Facebook Events, expand content during busy seasons, and use analytics for
            continuous improvements. The organization plans to implement our designs, underscoring their confidence in
            our work. This project highlights the ongoing nature of design and our enthusiasm for future opportunities.

          <h4> Redesigning the Department of Labor DOL Website Navigation </h4>
          <p> The core focus of the project was to redesign the Department of Labor's website to address user challenges
            in efficiently finding the resources they need. These challenges included a crowded and elongated menu that
            made it cumbersome for users to access items located below the fold. My contributions in defining user
            flows, conducting card sorting exercises, and participating in sitemap development were instrumental in
            improving user navigation and content accessibility. We prioritized the menu navigation, recognizing it as
            the primary point of interaction for users. Through card sorting and usability testing we were able to
            simplfy the navigation menu and tailor it to the different audiences that would most frequently visit the
            page. </p>
